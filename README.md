# Bayesian methods for efficient RL
Source for the workshop paper: E. Markou and C. E. Rasmussen, <em>Bayesian methods for efficient Reinforcement Learning in tabular problems</em>, appearing in the 2019 NIPS Workshop on Biological and Artificial RL.

We compare different Bayesian methods for representing an RL agent's uncertainty about cumulative rewards:

* Bayesian Q-Learning
*
